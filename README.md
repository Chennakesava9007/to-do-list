# 📝 To-Do List Application

A simple and responsive To-Do List web application with login & registration, category & priority sorting, dark mode toggle, and task deadline notifications built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project uses **localStorage** for user data and task persistence.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 User Registration & Login (stored in localStorage)
- ✅ Add, Edit, Complete, and Delete tasks
- 📆 Task Due Date with Notifications
- 📂 Task Categories (Work, Personal, Urgent)
- 🔺 Priority Levels (High, Medium, Low)
- 🌙 Toggle Dark Mode
- 💾 Saves tasks per user using `localStorage`

---

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Authentication**: Users can register with a username and password. Credentials are saved in `localStorage`.
2. **Task Handling**: Logged-in users can add tasks with:
   - a title,
   - a due date,
   - a category (Work, Personal, Urgent),
   - and a priority (High, Medium, Low).
3. **Notifications**: If permission is granted, the app will send browser notifications when tasks are due.
4. **Dark Mode**: Users can toggle between light and dark themes.

## 💡 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Web Notifications API
- `localStorage` API

---

## 🛡️ Security Note

This project is purely **client-side** and for **educational/demo purposes**. Authentication is handled via `localStorage`, which is **not secure** for production use. Never store sensitive data like real passwords in plaintext in `localStorage`.
